My capstone project involved analyzing customer contract renewal data provided by TXU Energy. In the end, we were to present our findings to the Director of the renewals team. I took on the position as the POC and led the conversations on behalf of my team. Our team was tasked to provide insights into the variables that impacted the renewal behavior of customers. We needed to come up with a contact strategy for customers with expiring terms to optimize costs and improve renewal rates. The first challenge our team faced was to understand the complicated data structure and prepare a meaningful dataset after cleaning the dataset. I led various meetings with the client to obtain a better understanding of the underlying data and variables. Given the nature of the data, it took us more than expected time to complete this step shrinking the available time for the analysis. I recognized the need to ramp up to produce the desired analysis in time. I crafted a plan of attack and brought my team onboard. We used our time efficiently to effectively divide and conquer the various parts of the analysis. In the end, we were able to segregate the customers into clusters using K-means machine learning model and figured out the best contact strategy for each cluster. The final step of the project was to summarize our findings for a non-technical audience. Our findings were very well received by the client, and they acknowledged the efforts made during the project.
