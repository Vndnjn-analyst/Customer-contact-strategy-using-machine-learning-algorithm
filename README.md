My capstone project involved analyzing customer contract renewal data provided by TXU Energy. The task was to provide insights into the variables that impacted the renewal behavior of customers. Also needed to come up with a contact strategy for customers with expiring terms to optimize costs and improve renewal rates. The first challenge was to understand the complicated data structure and prepare a meaningful dataset after cleaning the dataset.
I was able to segregate the customers into clusters using K-means machine learning model and figured out the best contact strategy for each cluster.
